	estimate and plot the survival function, cumulative hazard
	function, and their pair difference for Bayesian dynamic model
	with dynamic hazard from posterior sample. Specific examples are
	added to `bayesCox`.

2014-05-01 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Changed the dependence on boost to package BH.

2014-04-10 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed the problem that splineCox did not work with a single
	covariate by adding drop=FALSE in splineCox:
	    DF <- cbind(id=1:N, mf[, 1][, 1:2], mf[, -1, drop=FALSE])

	* Changed depends to import in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.
	However, package survival is kept under "Depends"; otherwise,
	function Surv was not found in model.matrix. This may need
	to be fixed later.

	data and formula.

2012-03-14  Jun Yan  <jun.yan@uconn.edu>
