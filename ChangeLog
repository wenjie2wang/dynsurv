	* Fixed compilation error in Solaris: "The function "exp" must
	have a prototype" by replacing `exp` with `std::exp`.

	* Fixed possibly invalid URL for tooth24.RData.

	* Changed CRAN URL into the canonical form.

	* Changed package version to 0.3-3.

2016-08-30 Wenjie Wang <wenjie.2.wang@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed warning on compilation flags in Makevars: "Non-portable
	flags in variable 'PKG_CXXFLAGS': -g" by removal of "-g" flag.

	* Fixed invalid URL for tooth24.RData.

	* Changed package version to 0.3-2.

2016-07-12 Wenjie Wang <wenjie.2.wang@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed compiling error from clang v3.9 due to including R headers
	inside extern "C" by commenting out the extern "C" in rng.h and
	GibbsSampler.h.

	* Fixed print function for bayesCox object.

	* Fixed invalid url for tooth dataset.

	* Added formula and xlevels to bayesCox object.

	* Added optional arguement to coef.bayesCox, coef.tvTran, and
	coef.splineCox to allow user to specify credible level by matching
	"..." argument with possible "level" argument.

	* Added function survCuvre, survDiff, and plotSurv to estimate and
	plot the survival function, cumulative hazard function, and their
	pair difference for Bayesian dynamic model with dynamic hazard
	from posterior sample. Specific examples are added to bayesCox.

	* Added Roxygen2 inline documentation for all exported function.

	* Added citation for package to /inst.

	* Removed redundant COPYRIGHT file bundled in source package. It
	is available online at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

	* Changed package version to 0.3-0.

	* Changed maintainer from Jun Yan to Wenjie Wang.

2014-05-01 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Changed the dependence on boost to package BH.

2014-04-10 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed compiling error from clang in thg constructor LogDenPar:
	changed this->N to static_cast<int> (this->N_).

	* Fixed warnings from clang in arm.c by commenting out the
	display function. Added random number state control to u_random.

2014-03-04 Jun Yan <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Fixed the problem that splineCox did not work with a single
	covariate by adding drop=FALSE in splineCox:
	    DF <- cbind(id=1:N, mf[, 1][, 1:2], mf[, -1, drop=FALSE])

	* Changed depends to import in DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.
	However, package survival is kept under "Depends"; otherwise,
	function Surv was not found in model.matrix. This may need
	to be fixed later.

	* Modified example codes to use mydata and myformula instead of
	data and formula.

2012-03-14  Jun Yan  <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Removed tiCox.h and tiCox.cpp. Functions there are covered
	by bayesCox.

	* Cleaned the style of the code under src with astyle -s2.

2012-03-10  Jun Yan  <jun.yan@uconn.edu>

	* Added system dependence on the boost library, which allows
	removal of the boost headers files from the src directory.
	The configure.ac file was adapted from that in package
	RQuantLib; thank Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.

	* Removed std:cout lines (Xiaojing Wang).

	* Replaced exit with return whenever possible. May need
	more fix later.
