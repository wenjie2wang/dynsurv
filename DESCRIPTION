Description: Time-varying coefficient models for interval censored and
    right censored survival data including
    1) Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or
    dynamic coefficients for right censored and interval censored data studied by
    Sinha et al. (1999) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00585.x> and
    Wang et al. (2013) <doi:10.1007/s10985-013-9246-8>,
    2) Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data
    proposed by Perperoglou et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.11.006>, and
    3) Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for right censored data
    using estimating equations proposed by
    Peng and Huang (2007) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asm058>.
