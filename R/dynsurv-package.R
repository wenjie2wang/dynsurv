##' dynsurv: Time-varying coefficient models for interval censored data.
##'
##' Functions to fit time-varying coefficient models for interval censored and
##' right censored survival data. Three major approaches are implemented:
##' \enumerate{
##' \item Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or dynamic
##'     coefficients for right censored and interval censored data;
##' \item Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored
##'     data;
##' \item Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for right censored
##'     data using estimating equations.
